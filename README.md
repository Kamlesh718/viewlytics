## 🚀 Viewlytics — AI-Powered Webpage Auditor

A small learning project to understand how to integrate AI (Gemini API) in real-world applications.

Viewlytics is a lightweight AI-assisted webpage analyzer that demonstrates how to send prompts to Google Gemini, parse its JSON-based responses, and display a structured audit in a clean UI.
This project is built using Next.js, React, and TailwindCSS, with server-side Gemini requests handled through a secure API route.
